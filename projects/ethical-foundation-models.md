## Problem

Foundation models present risks of exclusion, opacity, and bias at scale. This project investigated systemic harms and developed structured tools for ethical evaluation.

## Pipeline Overview

- **Lit Review**: Synthesized 30+ papers on data, governance, model risks.
- **Expert Interviews**: Gathered insights from policy, legal, research stakeholders.
- **Model Audit**: Compared 30+ models on transparency, inclusivity, documentation.
- **Codebook**: Created a taxonomy for ethical risk.
- **Framework**: AI Balance Sheet to balance performance, governance, and social impact.

## Impact

The project shifted the evaluation lens from performance to systemic accountability. The Balance Sheet framework supports institutional decision-making and reporting on foundation model deployment.
