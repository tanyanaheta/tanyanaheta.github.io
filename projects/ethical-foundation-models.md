title: "Ethical Evaluation of Foundation Models"
---

## Problem

Foundation models are powerful but poorly aligned with public interest. This project examined risks and governance failures and proposed a structured approach to evaluation.

## Pipeline Overview

- Synthesized 30+ research papers on risks, transparency, and power asymmetries.
- Conducted 12 expert interviews and coded key ethical themes.
- Built a codebook and used it to evaluate 30+ models for inclusion, documentation, and governance.
- Proposed a working draft of an AI Balance Sheet to formalize model accountability.

## Impact

Framework provides decision-makers with a structure to weigh social risks alongside performance. The AI Balance Sheet is under refinement and will serve as a basis for institutional audits or disclosures.
