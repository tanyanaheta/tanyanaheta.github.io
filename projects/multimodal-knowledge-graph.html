## ðŸ§© Problem

Traditional keyword search misses semantically similar real estate listings. This project used GraphML to recommend homes with similar design or layout using text, image, and metadata.

## ðŸ”§ Pipeline Overview

- **Data**: Zillow listings with images, descriptions, structured metadata.
- **Embeddings**: CLIP for images, TF-IDF for descriptions, normalized tabular data.
- **Graph Construction**: Nodes = listings; Edges = cosine similarity across modalities.
- **Modeling**: Trained GraphSAGE with contrastive loss on this multimodal graph.
- **Evaluation**: Recall, top-k match inspection, visual embedding validation.

## ðŸš€ Impact

Improved semantic search, listing recommendations, and property clustering. Prototype could power Zillow-like similarity APIs and enhance search personalization.
