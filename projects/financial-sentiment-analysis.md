## Problem

Investors and analysts need structured insights from unstructured filings. This project explored how sentiment from 10-Ks and earnings reports could serve as a predictive signal of company strategy and tone.

## Pipeline Overview

- **Data**: 500+ company filings (HTML, PDF).
- **Preprocessing**: Parsed sections using regex and heuristics; removed disclaimers and boilerplate.
- **Modeling**: Applied FinBERT to classify sentence-level sentiment.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted forward-looking phrases and aggregated sentiment at section and sector level.
- **Evaluation**: Compared sentiment to earnings outcomes, confirmed FinBERTâ€™s superior domain alignment over generic BERT.

## Impact

The pipeline revealed that tech companies consistently used more optimistic language, aligning with market growth expectations. The model showed clear use cases for investor dashboards and strategy monitoring tools.
