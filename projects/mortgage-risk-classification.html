## ðŸ§© Problem

Fannie Mae needed a system to predict 90+ day mortgage delinquencies to support underwriting and capital allocation. The objective was to develop an interpretable model that could flag high-risk loans early while being transparent for regulatory compliance.

## ðŸ”§ Pipeline Overview

- **Data**: 400K+ loan records from Fannie Mae (acquisition + performance data).
- **Label Engineering**: Defined 90-day delinquency target based on payment history.
- **Preprocessing**: Merged datasets, removed duplicates, normalized numeric features, encoded categories.
- **Statistical Testing**: Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U to confirm predictive feature significance.
- **Modeling**: Logistic regression with L2 regularization and grid-searched thresholds.
- **Evaluation**: AUC = 0.83; PR curves, confusion matrix, and calibration for cost-aligned decisions.

## ðŸš€ Impact

This interpretable model supported early risk detection, revealed high-risk borrower profiles, and could be integrated into underwriting dashboards. It provided direct decision signals and was robust enough to monitor for drift in production.
